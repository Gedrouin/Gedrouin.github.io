                    I am a student at the <a href="http://www.uri.edu">University of Rhode Island</a>. 
                I have many hobbies and things I like to do. 
                I like playing video games with my friends, playing ping-pong, and roller scating. 
                I like drawing and watching anime and many other movie seris. 
                My best friends and I have known each other since we where in preschool and have a very close bond even if we don't talk everyday anymore. 
                I have two cats I love dearly that are adorable and fluffy, I have always had a cat in the hosuehold since I was a baby and continue to love cats. 
                    My favorite animal is snow leopards.</p></td>
